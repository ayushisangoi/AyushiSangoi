# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayushi Sangoi  
### NSF Fellow | Data Specialist | PhD Candidate | ML Researcher | Engineer  
Turning complex data into clear, actionable insights, while empowering others around me.

I work at the intersection of **biomedical engineering, neuroscience, machine learning, full-stack development, and large‑scale data engineering**. With 7+ years of experience across clinical trials, neuroimaging, predictive modeling, hacking, teaching, and analytics, I build pipelines and solutions that turn raw data into meaningful decisions and provide solutions for key stakeholders.

### 🔬 Core Focus Areas
- Data Engineering & Pipelines  
- Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling  
- Neuroimaging Analytics (fMRI, physiological signals)  
- Clinical Data Processing (REDCap, MATLAB, R, Python)  
- Statistical Analysis & Decision Modeling  
- Data Visualization & Dashboarding  
- Teaching & Curriculum Design
